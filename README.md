# DATA-606: Capstone Project
## College Scorecard Analysis
Being an international student in the United States I know the importance of selecting a university while being on a budget. I still remember the amount of time I spent on the internet searching for universities, in my budget, which offer Data Science courses. The College Scorecard project will assist students to choose a university, considering their finances and the interested field of study.
